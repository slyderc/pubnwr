### GitHub Setup and Workflow

1. Repository Structure:
   - Main branch: production code
   - Development branch: active development
   - Feature branches: new features
   - Hotfix branches: urgent fixes

2. Initial GitHub Setup:
```bash
# After creating GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/pubnwr.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Create development branch
git checkout -b development
git push -u origin development
```

3. Recommended Workflow:
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature development

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"

# Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/new-feature

# After PR approval, merge to development
git checkout development
git merge feature/new-feature
git push origin development

# For production release
git checkout main
git merge development
git push origin main
```

4. Commit Message Format:
```
type: subject

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```
Types:
- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: documentation
- style: formatting
- refactor: code restructuring
- test: adding tests
- chore: maintenance

5. GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/python-app.yml):
```yaml
name: Python application

on:
  push:
	branches: [ main, development ]
  pull_request:
	branches: [ main, development ]

jobs:
  build:
	runs-on: ubuntu-latest
	steps:
	- uses: actions/checkout@v2
	- name: Set up Python
	  uses: actions/setup-python@v2
	  with:
		python-version: '3.10'
	- name: Install dependencies
	  run: |
		python -m pip install --upgrade pip
		if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
	- name: Run tests
	  run: |
		pytest
```

6. Protected Branches Setup:
   - Protect main and development branches
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require signed commits

7. Local Development Configuration:
   - Create local_config.ini for development
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Set up pre-commit hooks for linting and testing

8. Deployment Strategy:
   - Tag releases with semantic versioning
   - Use GitHub releases for documentation
   - Include migration steps in release notes
   - Document configuration changes

This setup provides a structured development environment with:
- Consistent code formatting
- Automated testing
- Version control best practices
- Collaborative development workflow
- Continuous integration
- Protected production code
- Organized feature development
